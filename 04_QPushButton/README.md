Qt uses a signal and slot mechanism to enable communication between objects in a safe and flexible way. This is one of the core features of Qt and allows loose coupling between UI components and logic.

**NOTE:** We use signals and slots for communication between objects in the Qt GUI. We use then many times for example with buttons, and text boxs.

### ðŸ“Œ What are Signals and Slots?
1. **Signal** â†’ A message emitted by an object when something happens (e.g., button clicked).
2. **Slot** â†’ A function that reacts to the signal (e.g., function that runs when a button is clicked).

### ðŸ”„ How It Works?
- A signal is emitted from an object.
- A slot receives the signal and executes some action.
- Qt automatically connects the signal to the slot, ensuring the function runs when needed.
